# These are not as different from upstream as they should be, but there's little that can be done about it right now until some issues are fixed. For a big TODO:
# Make disabler bolts go through windows, add duplicate taser bolts so upstream balance changes don't interfere
# Update the BatteryWeaponFireModes system so that it can support seperate gunshot sounds / sprites per fire mode. Then use taser.ogg instead of taser2 for the taser firing mode, and make the sprites switch depending on the mode.
